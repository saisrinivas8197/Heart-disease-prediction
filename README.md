- The heart disease prediction dataset, available on Kaggle, includes information on features such as age, sex, cholesterol, rest ECG, and thal. The analysis focuses on identifying which features are significant in predicting heart disease and how they can aid in making accurate predictions. This study aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to the development of heart disease and help in developing effective predictive models.
- To begin the analysis, exploratory data analysis was conducted, involving an examination of various column data types, identification of missing values and duplicate records, and plotting data distributions. These efforts helped to identify insights into the transformations that were required to prepare the data for subsequent modeling efforts. The EDA process allowed us to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and inform our approach to data preparation.
- Based on the conclusions drawn from the EDA, a pipeline was constructed that included several key operations and transformations. These included dropping duplicate features, performing log transformations for skewed variables, handling outliers, converting categorical variables to dummy variables using one-hot encoding, and scaling all continuous variables to a single scale. The resulting pipeline helped to streamline data preparation efforts and ensure that the data was optimized for subsequent modeling tasks. 
- Employed the pipeline to build two different machine learning algorithms, which were trained and tested on the dataset, resulting in an accuracy rate of 90% on the test dataset. The achieved accuracy rate is a crucial performance metric that assesses the models' ability to make correct predictions based on the input data. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the machine learning algorithms in accurately classifying instances and making informed decisions.
